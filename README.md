_An app for creatives to organize their projects_
you can add a project, upgrade it to an ongoing project, and mark it as done or important, save references and links, track the stage of the project and organize your projects in neat folders

## technology used
- vscode
- bcrypt
- dotenv
- ejs
- express
- express-session
- method-override
- mongoose
- morgan
- multer

## future work
- image upload functionality needs to be fixed
- clicking any card in the project should open an expanded card for details
- tracking the stage is still not functional
- percentage should be added to ongoing projects
