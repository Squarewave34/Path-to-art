# As a user, I would like to
## Main Flow
- Add all my art ideas into one place

> so basically I'm looking for three main sections

## section one: Stepping stone

- I want to add all my ideas as tasks
- I want to add steps to my ideas
- I want to add links to my inspo boards
- I want to be able to add links, images and notes to each task
- I want to be able to mark my work as either personal, commercial, or add a possible receiver
- I want to be able to edit
- I want to be able to add reminders and deadlines
- When a task is close to its deadline i want it to automatically go to an "important" folder/list

## section two: a beautiful unpaved path
- I want to be able to promote a task into an on going project
- I want to be able to track the state of the project, is it a sketch? line art? base color? shaded? rendered?
- I want to be able to able to adjust the milestones on my own to fit my own work flow
- i want to be able to adjust this specific project's milestones if i want it to be different
- I want to be able to see the date and time that i added this task, when i crossed any of the milestones and an elapsed time of my work
- I want to be able to turn the timing ON on a piece on command
- I want to see a percentage of how much left until a piece is finished
- I want to be able to put a project on pause
- I want to be able to return a project to the waiting list
- I want to be able to drop a project

## section three: The view was worth it
- I want to be able to close off a project once it's finished
- I want to be able to upload my finished art piece
- I want to see a gallery of my finished work
- I want to be able to click an image to see it's details, when i added it, when i worked on it, how much time did it take, the milestones associated with it
- I want to be able to return a finished project to an on going project
- I want to be able to see my art pieces organized according to their original folders
